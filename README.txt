This is a "Read Me" file for the Homework #2 submission.

All of the various packet traces are contained in two 
subdirectories:  Wired Monitoring and Wireless Monitoring.
For the three applications that I used (Wireshark, NetWalk,
and WinDump), the output files are stored in their original
form of PCAC file format.  However, to make it easier for
an analysis, I abstracted out the file's data and put it
into an Excel data file, which is named, "Analysis of Data
in Excel.xls".

The six various sheets contain the pertinent information 
from the packet's records from each of the six files.  The
way to execute any of the code is to do the following:

1) Select any of the Excel sheets.

2) Right-click at the bottom of the sheet and click 
on "View Code".

3) To see the code, click in the Project window and 
double-click the Modules to see the "mycode" VBA container.

4) Double-click on the code to see all of the VBA written.

5) Press "Control-G" for a debug window.

6) Type any of the the global module calls, such as:
	Analyze_Sheet_1 [HIT ENTER]

7) Then, the results will appear in the Debug Window.

So, this concludes the README.txt file which has explained
how to use the Excel file to see the code utilized to
analyze the network packet traces.
